## Art Style
Not relevant for the prototype, but will borrow concepts from my webcomic where its mainly monochromatic or sepiatone, but with certain things sometimes in color to emphasize its importance.

## Music
Not currently relevant, but the Sound Novel will be a hybrid of progressive metal and gothic rock, with living world lighter in tone than the world of the dead.
